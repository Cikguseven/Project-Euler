'''
The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is,
1^2+2^2+...+10^2=385

The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is,
(1+2+...+10)^2=55^2=3025

Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers and the square of the sum is 3025 âˆ’ 385 = 2640.

Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one hundred natural numbers and the square of the sum.
