'''
Starting in the top left corner of a 2×2 grid, and only being able to move to the right and down, there are exactly 6 routes to the bottom right corner.

How many such routes are there through a 20×20 grid?
'''

Using Combinatorics,
In order to reach bottom right corner of a 20x20 grid, we need to move right and down 20 times each, regardless of order.
Therefore, number of distinct routes = 40! / (20! x 20!) = 137846528820
